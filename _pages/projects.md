### Discrete-Time Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator | MATLAB, Simulink

This original work attempts to extend the concept of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) to the discrete-time domain wherein a
discrete-time robust control law based on UDE has been derived. Numerical simulations have also been performed to validate the efficacy of the control algorithm. Paper submitted and currently under review in the Automatica Journal.
