### Discrete-Time Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator | MATLAB, Simulink

This original work attempts to extend the concept of Uncertainty and Disturbance Estimator (UDE) to the discrete-time domain wherein a
discrete-time robust control law based on UDE has been derived. Numerical simulations have also been performed to validate the efficacy of the control algorithm. Paper submitted and currently under review in the Automatica Journal.

### Acute Infarct Location Classification | Python

Built a suitable CNN model to infer the acute infarct class locations on a small dataset. Further extented this to obtain the IR representation to enable the model to run on Intel NCS2.

### Silicon Carbide (SiC) Cycloconverter | MATLAB, Simulink

Presented a novel approach to design a cycloconverter using SiC MOSFET as opposed to the conventional usage of IGBT. Established a comparative study between the two with respect to Distortion and System Efficiency.
