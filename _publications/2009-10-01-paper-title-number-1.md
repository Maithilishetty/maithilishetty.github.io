excerpt: 'Silicon Carbide (SiC) MOSFET devices exhibiting several advantages, including high blocking voltage, lower conduction losses, and lower switching losses, when compared to silicon-based devices have become commercially available, enabling their adoption into power supply products. This paper presents a novel approach to designing a cycloconverter using SiC MOSFETs as opposed to the conventional usage of IGBT. A comparative study is attempted between the two with respect to distortion and system efficiency. MATLAB/Simulink models and simulations are used to analyze the results for the above.'
